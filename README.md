# NASA PROJECT CREATOR + CONTRIBUTOR ZONE by GAMAN
A Marketplace for Open Science Projects  - NASA Space Apps Challenges 2023

NASA Open Science Project Creator + Contributor Zone

We want to create a marketplace for open science projects so that open science projects will be more accessible for everyone who eager to contribute to science projects related to their interests. Also, we want to build a marketplace for project creators to find creators who match with all skills & expertise required in the project. In this web app, we create open science project marketplace which has some features as follows: (1) NASA SEARCH ENGINE - AI CHATTING BOT (2) NASA SUGGESTION SYSTEM / RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM (3) NASA COMMUNICATION TOOLS. 

With all those features, we are hoping that all interactions between project creators and contributor in any NASA Open Science Project will become more accessible, interactive, and fun. In addition, this web app will make NASA Open Data become easier to find and more organized.

You can try the demo in my Streamlit app: https://nasaproject2023-dzgwiak2nirgiw4ibixxjc.streamlit.app/

For AI Chatting Bot, here is the link to try: https://creator.voiceflow.com/prototype/65228db78a17c2d6818ac808

For communication tool between project creators and contributors, we will do video and chat in platform https://brie.fi/ng/ficky01#ficky01

Project Description - NASA Project Creator + Contributor Zone is a Web App

This Web App suggests and recommends users the most appropriate NASA Open Science Project based on keywords, fields of science, agency sponsor, geographic scope, and participation tasks.

Pain Point

Currently, there is no place online for Open Science project creators and skilled participants to find each other, mingle, and foster professional relationships to work on interesting open research projects. Thus, we propose the creation of this project: NASA Project Creator + Contributor Zone.
The idea behind this project is to provide a valuable solution that open science contributors in looking for interesting and relevant project ideas based on their interest and expertises.

Objectives

The main objectives of this web app is to create a marketplace for open science projects so that open science projects will be more accessible for everyone who eager to contribute to science projects related to their interests. Also, we want to build a marketplace for project creators to find creators who match with all skills & expertise required in the project. We will be building this marketplace in web application using Machine Learning, Large Language Model (LLM), Generative AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP).
