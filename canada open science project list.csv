Air quality in Quebec City,"Laboratoire citoyen, Fonds de Recherche du Québec (FRQ) - Programme ENGAGEMENT, Groupe de Chimie Atmosphérique de l'Université de Montréal, Drave Développement, Atelier créatif La Patente, CRE Capitale-Nationale",Quebec
,"In Quebec, there is an absence of air quality measurements based on sectors or proximity to sources. Do we want to know the impact of wood heating on smog in Quebec? Or the pollution generated by car traffic in a neighborhood? There are 8 measuring stations installed in the Quebec City agglomeration for a population of 800,000 inhabitants. Thus, sensors in a high-density network would be useful to better understand the spatial distribution of air pollution and its impact in various local communities.",
